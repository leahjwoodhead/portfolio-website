    <p>Welcome to my first website! Here you can find info about my journey into Software Development, look at my current projects, and ask me anything about my journey into tech!
        I began coding at the start of lockdown as I wanted to try out a new hobby, and ended up really enjoying it! While it is possible to self-learn programming languages, 
        I knew that I would study best following a course, and Northcoders seemed perfect! Here is my first attempt at HTML and CSS to build a website! Enjoy!
