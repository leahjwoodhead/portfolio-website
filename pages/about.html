        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Leah. I graduated from Durham University with a degree in Philosophy, but decided to retrain in Software Development following my graduation. After dabbling in Python, HTML and CSS through various online resources, I thought the best way to learn would be through a coding bootcamp. I enrolled with Northcoders - the best decision I have made!I am currently half-way through the course, having completed the Javascript Fundamentals and Back-end block. </p>

      <p>Outside of coding, I love to pass the time with various hobbies and projects. Primarily, Netflix! However, I also love cooking, going for walks and trying out a range of creative activities.</p>
